# Real Estate Parcels & Agriculture Guide - Excel Project
Identify the top 30 crops, along with all perennials, suitable for growth in every parcel within California. Based on USDA standards, Hardiness Zones and temperature zones are utilized to determine the crops suitable for each parcelâ€™s environment. With CDFA reports and filtered ChatGPT insights, this report is composed of accurate real estate data and the 2023 market performance of the top 30 crops. Listed below are several metrics utilized to inform future agents and buyers.

# Hardiness Zone
The Hardiness Zone is a USDA standard that gardeners and growers use to determine which plants are most likely to thrive in a given area.
